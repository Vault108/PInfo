# Installing

First we need to install the requirements.

We can do that by running:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

You can now run the program by using:
     
     python3 PInfo.py

Alternatively you can add an alias to run the command.  

Something like the following in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` will work

     alias pinfo='python3 ~/PInfo/PInfo.py'

Remember to source your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` after adding it. 
     
     source ~/.bashrc
     source ~/.zshrc
